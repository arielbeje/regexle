# Regexle

A game where you need to guess the RegEx pattern based on its matches.

Avoid reading the `consts.ts` file if you don't want to know the solutions.

## Disclaimer

I have used this project to learn frontend development, so its code isn't the best.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
